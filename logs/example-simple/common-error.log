Teaching a group of farmers in Burkina Faso to use weaver ants in this way took just a day. Those farmers no longer use pesticides to control fruit flies, and so are able to market their mangoes as organic to eager European consumers, vastly increasing their income. The ants, so to speak, are on the march. \\\",\\\"difficulty\\\":0,\\\"parentID\\\":null,\\\"jsonStr\\\":null}\",\"voice\":\"\",\"questSourceTemp\":\"考无忧\",\"typeNameTemp\":\"阅读理解\",\"createDateTemp\":\"2018-03-05 08:57:49\",\"modifyDateTemp\":\"2018-03-05 02:06:32\",\"numsum\":0,\"errsum\":0,\"flag\":0,\"num\":0,\"score\":0,\"recovery\":0},\"flag\":0},{\"iD\":153818,\"pID\":1409,\"sID\":4726,\"qCID\":\"cc5b50c6-6708-42eb-84fa-c22b287f7078\",\"quesScore\":10,\"priority\":3,\"question\":{\"iD\":\"cc5b50c6-6708-42eb-84fa-c22b287f7078\",\"aID\":104,\"addDate\":\"2018-03-05T11:47:18.7330000+08:00\",\"modifyDate\":\"2018-03-05T03:50:47.0000000+08:00\",\"typeNo\":9,\"showTypeID\":166,\"parentID\":\"\",\"difficulty\":0,\"titleHTML\":\"&nbsp; &nbsp; For its supporters, the idea of growing single-celled algae on exhaust gas piped from power stations is the ultimate in recycling.

Eventually the polyester is unable to support the weight of the algae, and they fall off into a collection duct positioned underneath”，这个收容器是用来接住那些经过光合作用后掉下来的藻类的，其中“unable to support the weight of the algae”说明藻类开始变得过重，因此C选项为正确答案。<br/>4. 细节题。根据第三段，绿色燃料公司是使用了废气作为让藻类活动的动力，而与清洁技术相同的是在这个过程中也有光合作用，光也来自外部，也有碳固定下来。因此，不同之处就是D选项。<br/>5. 细节题。根据倒数第二段“GreenFuel claims that over the course of a year, a hectare (2.5 acres) of its reactors should be able to produce 30,000 litres (8,000 American gallons) of oil, which could be used as biodiesel, and enough carbohydrates to be fermented into 9,000 litres of ethanol, which can be used as a substitute for petrol”，反应器只可以制造酒精作为石油的替代品，不能制造石油。因此，D是正确答案。<br/>\\\",\\\"titleHTML\\\":\\\"&nbsp; &nbsp; For its supporters, the idea of growing single-celled algae on exhaust gas piped from power stations is the ultimate in recycling.

Say you&#39;re phoned about your daily intake on a day when it was someone&#39;s birthday at work and you had a slice of cake. You may not report it, thinking that a typical day wouldn&#39;t include the cake...forgetting yesterday&#39;s &quot;special occasion&quot; piece of pizza, and the Big Gulp of the day before. Or, despite the portion size guides you get, you characterize your bagel from the deli as a 4-ounce standard serving when a 4-ounce bagel hasn&#39;t been sighted in any major city for a decade.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;You can&#39;t put a camera in everyone&#39;s belly and see exactly what they ate,&quot; says Christopher Gardner, a nutrition scientist at the Stanford Prevention Research Center who has recently published research on garlic and diet plans. You can get around this in some studies by taking objective measurements. Weight, for example, or if you&#39;re assessing intake of fruits and veggies, you can measure the level of pigments called carotenoids in the blood. In the breast cancer study, blood tests showed that the study subjects actually did eat more fruits and veggies (carotenoid concentration was 73 percent higher in those women after one year and 43 percent higher after four years). But objective measures can&#39;t definitively nail down whether someone is eating nutrients in certain proportions.\\\",\\\"difficulty\\\":0,\\\"parentID\\\":null,\\\"jsonStr\\\":null}\",\"voice\":\"\",\"questSourceTemp\":\"考无忧\",\"typeNameTemp\":\"阅读理解\",\"createDateTemp\":\"2018-03-05 14:17:51\",\"modifyDateTemp\":\"2018-03-05 06:23:30\",\"numsum\":0,\"errsum\":0,\"flag\":0,\"num\":0,\"score\":0,\"recovery\":0},\"flag\":0},{\"iD\":153830,\"pID\":1409,\"sID\":4726,\"qCID\":\"ba19df27-7f3a-4c56-851e-dec6b68be5e3\",\"quesScore\":10,\"priority\":5,\"question\":{\"iD\":\"ba19df27-7f3a-4c56-851e-dec6b68be5e3\",\"aID\":103,\"addDate\":\"2018-03-06T09:05:47.3930000+08:00\",\"modifyDate\":\"2018-03-06T09:05:47.3930000+08:00\",\"typeNo\":9,\"showTypeID\":166,\"parentID\":\"\",\"difficulty\":0,\"titleHTML\":\"<br/>Some of the concerns surrounding Turkey’s application to join the European Union, to be voted on by the EU’s Council of Ministers on December 17th, are economic-in particular, the country’s relative poverty.

But in the case of weaver ants in Africa, this description may be more than just a metaphor. According to Paul van Mele of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and his colleagues, African mango farmers could increase their harvests by as much as two-thirds with the help of these doughty insects.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mangoes in Africa, as elsewhere, often fall prey to fruit flies, which destroy about 40% of the continent&#39;s crop. In fact, fruit flies are so common in African mangoes that America has banned their import altogether, to protect its own orchards. African farmers, meanwhile, have few practical means to defend their fruit. Chemical pesticides are expensive. <span style=(qiuzhikejiB)text-decoration: underline;(qiuzhikejiB)>And even for those who can afford them they are not that effective since, by the time a farmer spots an infestation, it is too late to spray.</span> Added to that, spraying tall trees is a much more complicated and unhealthy business than treating low-growing fruit and vegetables.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Agricultural scientists have also looked at controlling fruit flies with parasitic wasps. But the most common ones kill off only about one fly in 20, leaving plenty of survivors to go on the rampage. Lethal traps baited with fly-attracting pheromones are another option. But they, too, are expensive. <span style=(qiuzhikejiB)text-decoration: underline;(qiuzhikejiB)>Moreover, all these methods require farmers to detect the presence of fruit flies, and to identify them as the main threat to their crop—no mean feat when most of the action is taking place in dense, leafy canopies ten metres off the ground.</span> Instead, most farmers simply harvest their fruit early, when it is not yet fully ripe. This makes it less vulnerable to the flies, but also less valuable.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Farmers whose trees are teeming with weaver ants, however, do not need to bother with any of this. In a survey of several orchards in Benin, Dr van Mele and his colleagues found an average of less than one fruit-fly pupa in each batch of 30 mangoes from trees where weaver ants were abundant, but an average of 77 pupae in batches from trees without weaver ants. The weaver ants, it turns out, are very thorough about hunting down and eating fruit flies, as well as a host of other pests. The only drawback is the ants&#39; painful bite, which can be avoided by harvesting fruit with poles, rather than climbing trees.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Weaver ants have been used for pest control in China and other Asian countries for centuries. The practice has also been adopted in Australia. But Dr van Mele argues that it is particularly suited to Africa since weaver ants are endemic to the mango-growing regions of the continent, and little training or capital is needed to put them to work. All you need do is locate a suitable nest and run string from it to the trees you wish to protect. The ants will then quickly find their way to the target. Teaching a group of farmers in Burkina Faso to use weaver ants in this way took just a day. Those farmers no longer use pesticides to control fruit flies, and so are able to market their mangoes as organic to eager European consumers, vastly increasing their income.
